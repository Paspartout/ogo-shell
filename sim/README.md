# ogo-shell Simulation

To accelerate developement of application logic I built a "simulation" of
the odroid-go hardware api functions using SDL2.
I basically implemented all the functions declared in `../components/hardware/include/*.h` for the odroid-go and for the simulation in this folder.

If you got a Linux Machine running and SDL2 installed you should be able to build it using the Makefile.
